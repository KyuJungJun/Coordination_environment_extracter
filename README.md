# Coordination_environment_extracter
This repository includes samples codes that extract Li coordination environment information referenced to a perfect tetrahedron or octahedron. Volume of the polyhedron, continuous symmetry measure (CSM) and coordinate will be provided.

Please refer to the paper "Lithium superionic conductors with corner-sharing frameworks" for detailed explanation of sample code.
